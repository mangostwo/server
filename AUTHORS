Unfortunately we have no detailed information of the history of the WoWD project;
if somebody can provide information, please contact us, so that we can make this history available

The third party libraries have their own way of addressing authorship, and the authorship of commits importing/ updating
a third party library reflects who did the importing instead of who wrote the code within the commit.

These are the authors that contributed to the files available within this package since 2005.
The Authors of third party libraries are not explicitly mentioned, and usually are possible to obtain from the files belonging to the third party libraries.

Please inform us, if you find somebody who is missing!
